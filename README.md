# Memory Game Project
The Memory Gmae project is based on the famous card game where you have to flip over two cards and match them.

## Table of Contents

* [Instructions](#instructions)
How to play the game? Click on the cards, they will flip over. Once the cards match, they will stay flipped over exposing thei symbols and they will change color. When all cards are matched you will see your results of how long it took you, how many moves it took to get all cards right and how many "lives - in the shape of stars" you have left.

## Instructions - how to extract the code for the game

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
